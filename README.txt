1st task: evaluate 9 hypotheses using ICE and RICE approaches.
2nd task: launch adequate AB-test.

I. Data preprocessing - we need the data to be brought to the required types and uniformity, otherwise it is difficult to filter.

II. Hypothesis prioritization on the Ice Rice methods to help managers decide which product hypothesis will hit the team the least but will (probably) bring the most value to the business.

III. Visualize data, pay attention to anomalies. Our task also includes this: to prevent hasty decisions from being made on the basis of superficial data analysis. This is what happens when you just look at charts. Catching mind traps.

IV. Find outliers that affect the result and interpretation of the graphs.

V. We analyze ab-test, the threshold of statistical significance is 0.05. We look at whether we reject the null hypothesis (that groups A and B are equal) or whether there is reason to believe that there is a tangible difference. We clean the data and check what has changed.

VII. We give our vision in [Results of the work] (#concl). We are trying to convince the "decision makers".
